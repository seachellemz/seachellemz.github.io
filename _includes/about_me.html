            I have over 15 years of experience as a software engineer.  I have worked for a largee corporation as a Distinguished Engineer with focus on middleware technologies and performance.  Most recently I have been focusing on non-profits and small startups. 
 While I'm a proficient full-stack developer, my expertise is in building and supporting scalable backend services.

           I love software new technologies, coding and troubleshooting problems in performance. 
           While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle,
           I'm most attracted to solving real customer problems with a business justification.
           I'm always interested in any opportunity where I can apply my current technical expertise or have an opportunity to grow.
